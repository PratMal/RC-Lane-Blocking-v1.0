# RC-Lane-Blocking-v1.0
First prototype for Lane Blocking for a Raspberry Pi RC Car. Made for ATL Marathon 2023-24 (Theme : Mobility)

Lane blocking i.e. not being able to go out of a specified lane using lane markings of contrasting color from the road (currently using yellow). This is just a prototype and needs some serious rework, so just use this for ideas and make your own iteration. (or wait until i come up with the 2nd version if needed, i have a lot of ideas on how to make this better)


*apparently i didn't backup the code on my system so the code is stuck on that damned pi. have to wait for a while till i get it back. till then you can see the use case of this repo in our project video!*
